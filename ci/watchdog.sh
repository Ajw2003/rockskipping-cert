# The last-resort restarter for the hourly pad-cert-watch chain. GitHub's
# `schedule:` trigger is unreliable, so pad-cert-watch.yml chains itself by
# dispatching its own next run -- but that chain has no restarter if it ever
# stops. This script is that restarter: it wakes up every 5 minutes (its own
# `schedule:` trigger, which is fine to miss occasionally since a duplicate
# wakeup just exits) and, if nobody else is already running this loop and the
# chain looks stale, dispatches pad-cert-watch.yml. Before it
# times out (GitHub caps a job at 6h) it dispatches its own successor so the
# loop never actually stops.
